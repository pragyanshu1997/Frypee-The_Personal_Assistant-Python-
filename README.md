# Frypee-The_Personal_Assistant-Python-
A personal assistant that could perform some automated tasks using the scripts.
Frypee is a sort of personal assistant(actually a prototype).It is made in python and uses google speech recognition API to convert speech to text. It uses urllib and BeautifulSoup for scraping the web and a json parser to explore the data received. You can search for meaning of any word, temperature of any city, your current location, current time, etc. Also, it uses image recognition using OpenCV to unlock the script by detecting your face with the help of machine learning.The code is purely built on Python and with some basic modules.
